## Framework

### 1. Regulate Digital Assets Under a Separate Framework

1. Define **_"digital asset"_** as a financial asset issued and transferred
   using distributed ledger or blockchain technology.

    **_"Financial asset"_** would include an asset whose primary use is as a
    payment instrument, medium of exchange, means of storing value, or otherwise
    as a financial interest.

2. In creating a new regulatory framework for digital assets, Congress should
    recognize in law that all digital assets, including digitally native
    versions of traditional financial assets, should be subject to a new
    regulatory regime for digital assets.

### 2. Designate One Regulator for Digital Asset Markets

1. Authority would include:

    1. A new registration process established for marketplaces for digital
        assets (**_"MDAs"_**).

    2. Appropriate disclosures to inform purchasers of digital assets.

2. MDA regulation should support the efficiency benefits of
    straight-through-processing.

3. MDAs should be authorized to perform the full lifecycle of digital asset
    services, including digital asset trading, transfer (e.g., wallet services),
    custody, clearing, money payment, staking, borrowing and lending, and
    related incidental services.

4. The regulator should be authorized to offer different registration paths for
    different kinds of MDAs depending on the scope of activities they provide.

5. Regulations should focus on equal and open access to digital asset trading
    for all market participants — retail and institutional.

6. A dedicated self-regulatory organization (**"_SRO"_**) should be established
    to strengthen the oversight regime and provide more granular oversight of
    MDAs.

    1. All registered MDAs should be required to be members of the SRO.

    2. The SRO should establish the self-certification process that an MDA would
        use to make a digital asset available for trading on its platform.

7. The framework would preempt state-by-state registration and related
    regulatory requirements.

8. The treatment of platforms and services that do not custody or otherwise
    control the assets of a customer would need to be inherently different from
    an MDA that holds and controls customer assets, and is therefore not
    addressed by this framework.

### 3. Promote Interoperability and Fair Competition

1. MDAs must be interoperable with products and services across the
    cryptoeconomy.

2. The new regulatory framework should encourage communication, competition and
    cross-pollination among protocols, applications, and MDAs.

## Goals

### 1. Enhance transparency through appropriate disclosure requirements

1. The information environment for digital assets should focus on the material
   characteristics, benefits, and risks of the asset itself. An asset-centric
   approach would include information about the features of underlying projects
   that investors are likely to find most relevant in their purchase or use
   decisions.

  1. For digital assets that are debt or equity securities, many of the current
      securities disclosure requirements may be appropriate.

  2. Digital assets that are well-established, broadly understood, and
      decentralized, like Bitcoin and Ether, should not require ongoing
      disclosure.

  3. Digital tokens that are earlier in the life cycle, and not yet
      decentralized, should have a minimum set of disclosures. For example,
      those could be based on key features of the white papers that are already
      widely used by the industry.

  4. Asset-backed tokens, like stablecoins and other digital assets that are
      pegged to a particular value or fiat currency and maintain a reserve of
      assets designed to ensure they maintain the peg, require a different type
      of disclosure. The disclosures should be appropriate to how they are being
      used, which is inherently different from money market funds.

2. Disclosure requirements must be flexible, so they can be readily applied to a
   wide range of digital assets and so they are resilient in the face of future
   innovation.

  1. The assigned federal regulator — together with the new SRO — must also take
      a flexible and nimble approach with the disclosure requirements rules that
      the information environment applied in practice.

  2. Where additional guidance is needed, there should be a straightforward
      process for obtaining timely, case-specific, interpretive, or exemptive
      relief.

### 2. Protect against fraud and market manipulation

1. An MDA would need to make available required disclosures about the digital
   assets it supports.

2. It should establish requirements and mechanisms for executing transactions on
   MDA platforms, including for order book matching.

3. The MDA should have the ability to monitor trading activity on its platforms
   and to enforce its trading requirements.

4. MDAs should provide clear information about their operations to the public.

### 3. Promote efficiency and strengthen market resiliency

Each of the goals should be accomplished in recognition of the unique
characteristics and risks of the underlying functionalities of digital assets.

1. Rules for MDAs should account for market participants having direct access to
   exchange services, and not through broker-dealers as gatekeepers.

2. The regulations should prescribe baseline requirements around cyber and
   operational integrity and resiliency.

3. They should include requirements for post-trade transparency of material
   terms of digital asset transactions conducted on the platform.

4. Rules should include requirements for asset safekeeping and use, to address
   financial stability by requiring MDAs to maintain adequate capital and
   liquidity, to facilitate customer portability, to promote interoperability,
   and provide clear disclosures regarding the services provided and associated
   fees.

5. MDAs would be required to implement a compliance program, including coverage
   of BSA AML requirements. Appropriately tailored customer identification,
   transaction monitoring, SAR filing requirements, and OFAC and sanctions
   screening obligations should all remain as available resources.

6. MDAs should be required to mitigate and disclose potential conflicts of
   interest.

7. MDAs must also consider and address risks arising from the role played by
   market-makers and other liquidity providers on their trading venues.
